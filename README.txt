STUDIO SEVEN - Static Website Package
-------------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html, portfolio.html, packages.html, booking.html, gallery.html, about.html, contact.html, policy.html
- assets/css/style.css
- assets/js/main.js
- assets/images/logo.svg + placeholder images

How to host:
1. Upload the entire folder to any static hosting platform:
   - GitHub Pages (push to a repo, enable Pages from main branch)
   - Netlify (drag-and-drop the folder or connect the repo)
   - Vercel (import the repo)
   - Any static host or shared hosting (put files in public_html or www)
2. Ensure index.html is at the root.
3. To accept bookings via email, replace 'studio.seven@example.com' in assets/js/main.js and contact.html with your real studio email.
4. Replace placeholder images in assets/images with your real portfolio images (keep names or update img srcs in gallery script).
